# Author Identification (Artificial Intelligence & Technology Olympics)

An NLP project for author identification using binary word-presence features.

---

## Introduction and Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a supervised learning model that predicts the author of a text sample based solely on the presence or absence of specific words. Each sample is represented by binary features and the target column `author`.

---

## Dataset

**Training set**
- Columns: binary word indicators (0/1) and `author` (target).

**Test set**
- Same word columns, without `author`.
- Number of rows: **2765**

**Example structure**

| word_1 | word_2 | ... | word_n | author       |
|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------------|
|   0    |   1    | ... |   1    | Mason Reed   |
|   1    |   1    | ... |   1    | Ava Thompson |
|   0    |   1    | ... |   0    | Liam Carter  |


## Project Overview
This project was part of the Artificial Intelligence & Technology Olympics, developed by the AI Department of AIM Startup. Our team participated in the Author Identification challenge, which involved building an NLP-based machine learning model to classify the author of each text.
